hess-triangle
=============

GeoJSON and shapefile for Hess' Triangle, a tiny parcel of land that was left behind when New York City extended 7th Avenue in 1914. Its owners left a tiled message that reads "Property of the hess estate which has never been dedicated for public purposes" in eternal protest of the taking. Made with NYC's mapPLUTO dataset.
